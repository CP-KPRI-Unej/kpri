## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## Comment Management

The website includes a comment management system for articles. Administrators can:

- View all comments for each article
- Filter comments by status (pending, approved, rejected)
- Approve or reject comments
- Delete unwanted comments

Comments have three possible statuses:
- **Pending**: New comments awaiting moderation
- **Approved**: Comments that have been approved and are visible to users

To manage comments for an article:
1. Go to the Articles list in the admin dashboard
2. Click the three-dot menu for the article you want to manage
3. Select "Manage Comments"
4. Use the tabs to filter comments by status
5. Use the action menu for each comment to change its status or delete it
